### Watermarking

You can add a watermark to your image. This can be useful for adding your name/tagline/twitter handle to the image. If you want, you can also add an image, once you do this, the watermark will be combined with the image.

By default, you can place the image on the top or at the bottom, but you can also drag it around to place it wherever you want.
